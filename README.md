# University Management System (OOP Project)

This Python project is an object-oriented system for managing students and professors. 
It allows professors to input the courses they provide (up to 5 courses) and students to view these courses and select units. 
Student selections are saved in individual text files. 
The system also calculates age from the year of birth and displays detailed personal information.

**Features:**
- Object-oriented structure with inheritance (`Persons`, `Students`, `Professors`)
- Interactive menus for professors and students
- Course management and selection with file persistence
- Age calculation and information display
